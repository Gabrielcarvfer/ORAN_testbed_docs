Multipass
=========

.. _Multipass: https://multipass.run/
.. _Canonical: https://canonical.com/
.. _Vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/

`Multipass`_ is `Canonical`_'s solution for easy Virtual Machine
(VM) management. Think of it like `Vagrant`_, but from the Ubuntu makers.

It is super easy to setup and use it.

Installing Multipass
--------------------

Multipass can easily be installed and kept up-to-date using
Canonical's Snap packages. To install Multipass, use
the command ``snap install multipass``.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ sudo snap install multipass
    [sudo] password for username:
    multipass 1.12.2 from Canonicalâœ“ installed

Now we can see the available images to instantiate a VM.

Looking for images to instantiate a VM
--------------------------------------

To list the available images that can be use to create a new VM,
use the command ``multipass find``.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ multipass find

Let's assume we want a Ubuntu 20.04 VM and we now want to instantiate it.

Instantiating a VM
------------------

To instantiate a new VM, use ``multipass launch --name vm_instance_name image_name``.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ multipass launch --name testvm 20.04
    Launched: testvm

Inspecting a VM
---------------

To inspect the VM configuration, use ``multipass info vm_instance_name``.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ multipass info testvm 20.04
    Name:           testvm
    State:          Running
    IPv4:           10.142.101.175
    Release:        Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
    Image hash:     f5cdf6bf458b (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
    CPU(s):         1
    Load:           0.67 0.41 0.16
    Disk usage:     1.5GiB out of 4.8GiB
    Memory usage:   146.1MiB out of 959.4MiB
    Mounts:         --

Very restrictive for our purposes, so let's shut it down and reconfigure
the configuration of the VM.

Stopping a VM
-------------

To stop a VM, use ``multipass stop vm_instance_name``.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ multipass stop testvm
    $ multipass list
    Name                    State             IPv4             Image
    testvm                  Stopped           --               Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

Now that the VM is stopped, we can proceed to change its configuration.

Reconfigure a VM configuration
------------------------------

So let's add to our test VM some additional cores, memory and disk space.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ multipass set local.testvm.cpus=8
    $ multipass set local.testvm.memory=10GB
    $ multipass set local.testvm.disk=10GB
    $ multipass start testvm
    $ multipass info testvm
    Name:           testvm
    State:          Running
    IPv4:           10.142.101.175
    Release:        Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
    Image hash:     f5cdf6bf458b (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
    CPU(s):         8
    Load:           0.21 0.05 0.02
    Disk usage:     1.5GiB out of 9.6GiB
    Memory usage:   218.2MiB out of 9.7GiB
    Mounts:         --

Much better! But how do we access the VM shell?

Getting into a VM
-----------------

For end-users, getting into the VM just requires SSHing into the server
with their credentials. We are going to dump you straight into your
respective VM shell. And if you try escaping from it, we kill your VM.

For administrators, we get there using:

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ multipass exec testvm -- bash
    ubuntu@testvm:~$ exit
    $

Sharing files to/from a VM
--------------------------

Like Docker, Multipass allows us to mount shared volumes.
Let's see it in action.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ multipass mount ./ testvm:/home/ubuntu/multipass
    $ ls
    $ multipass exec testvm -- bash
    ubuntu@testvm:~/multipass/$ ls
    ubuntu@testvm:~/multipass/$ echo "Hello world!" > test.txt
    ubuntu@testvm:~/multipass/$ ls
    test.txt
    ubuntu@testvm:~/multipass/$ exit
    $ ls
    test.txt
    $ cat test.txt
    Hello world!

As we can see, we have access to the shared directory via both sides.

Unsharing files to/from a VM
----------------------------

Shared directories will persist and need to be manually removed
if sharing is only meant for copying configuration files and such.

To unshare a directory, use the following.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ multipass info testvm
    Name:           testvm
    State:          Running
    IPv4:           10.142.101.175
    Release:        Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
    Image hash:     f5cdf6bf458b (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
    CPU(s):         8
    Load:           0.21 0.05 0.02
    Disk usage:     1.5GiB out of 9.6GiB
    Memory usage:   218.2MiB out of 9.7GiB
    Mounts:         /host/directory => /home/ubuntu/multipass
                    UID map: 1000:default
                    GID map: 1000:default
    $ multipass unmount testvm:/home/ubuntu/multipass
    $ multipass info testvm
    Name:           testvm
        State:          Running
        IPv4:           10.142.101.175
        Release:        Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
        Image hash:     f5cdf6bf458b (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
        CPU(s):         8
        Load:           0.21 0.05 0.02
        Disk usage:     1.5GiB out of 9.6GiB
        Memory usage:   218.2MiB out of 9.7GiB
        Mounts:         --

Pretty neat, ain't it?

Removing a VM
-------------

Removing VMs involve stopping them, then deleting their entry,
then purging its data.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ multipass stop testvm
    $ multipass list
    Name                    State             IPv4             Image
    testvm                  Stopped           --               Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
    $ multipass delete testvm
    $ multipass list
    Name                    State             IPv4             Image
    testvm                  Deleted           --               Not Available
    $ multipass purge
    $ multipass list
    No instances found.
