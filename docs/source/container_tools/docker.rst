Docker: high-quality drop shipping
==================================

.. _Docker Website: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/

Docker is a toolset that allows for the containerization of applications.

Think of it as a virtual machine (e.g. Virtualbox, KVM, QEMU, VMWare, Hyper-V),
but a lot slimmer, since there is no hardware switching happening between the
host and the guest operating systems.

The container replaces the userspace of the host operating system, isolating
its dependencies from the host system, allowing for development without the
interference of third-party tools that may spread dependencies around like crazy.

Much more information about Docker can be found in their `Docker Website`_.

Rootless Docker
---------------

.. _Rootless Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/

While Docker is awesome, the default installation via `apt install docker`
usually results in a Docker installation that is capable of escalating
privileges and exposing the host operating system by requiring sudo to run.

This can be really dangerous if proper security practices are not followed.
For people who don't care, good like. For those that do, install the
`Rootless Docker`_ version.

First steps
-----------

Really basic stuff regarding docker. Can also be used as a cheatsheet in
case your memory is as bad as mine.

Looking for a pre-built container image
---------------------------------------

.. _Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/

One of the things that popularized Docker were the pre-built container
images available at `Docker Hub`_. Some of which are just a few hundred
megabytes in size, allowing for a single consumer-level machine to host
and test a project in several linux distributions.

Ubuntu, for example, has multiple containers, one for each release
(``20.04``, ``22.04``, ``23.04``, ``23.10``), plus additional tags
for ``latest`` and ``rolling``.

.. image:: img/ubuntu_docker_hub_page.png
   :width: 100%

To download one of the ubuntu images, ``docker image pull`` specifying
the container image name and tag:

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker image pull ubuntu:22.04
    22.04: Pulling from library/ubuntu
    aece8493d397: Pull complete
    Digest: sha256:2b7412e6465c3c7fc5bb21d3e6f1917c167358449fecac8176c6e496e5c1f05f
    Status: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu:22.04
    docker.io/library/ubuntu:22.04

You can check the container image was properly downloaded by running ``docker image ls``:

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker image ls
    REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
    ubuntu       22.04     e4c58958181a   7 weeks ago   77.8MB

Container images by themselves, however, don't do anything.
We need to create a container first.

Creating the first container
----------------------------

We need to attach it to a container, that will use it as its base disk drive (e.g. ``/``).

To do that, we use ``docker container create`` command:

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker container create --name mycontainer ubuntu:22.04
    d60703e8847a1845e9e7566aa8bd2a0273d9cacdd9ebff725e6ed600e3c98dcf

That container will be created but will not be running all by itself.
We can double check this is the case with ``docker container ls``, which shows running
containers, and ``docker container ls -a``, which shows all containers.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker container ls

    $ docker container ls -a
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND       CREATED          STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
    d60703e8847a   ubuntu:22.04   "/bin/bash"   14 seconds ago   Created             mycontainer


Note that we passed a name for the container when creating it. That is for ease of use.
If you don't pass it, you will need to refer to the container via its Container ID (the
gigantic hexadecimal string you saw printed before, or its shorthand shown above).

To remove a container, use ``docker container rm containername``.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker container ls -a
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND       CREATED          STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
    d60703e8847a   ubuntu:22.04   "/bin/bash"   14 seconds ago   Created             mycontainer
    $ docker container rm mycontainer
    mycontainer
    $ docker container ls -a
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND       CREATED          STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
    $ docker container create --name mycontainer ubuntu:22.04
    306b5af9ab3bbae1e0049a456ca4e420e571d9a288a53c60a2a596525f0c15af
    $ docker container ls -a
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND       CREATED          STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
    306b5af9ab3b   ubuntu:22.04   "/bin/bash"   14 seconds ago   Created             mycontainer

Now we will have a container that can be run. We can run interactively, or non-interactively.
Below we see each case separately.

Running non-interactively
-------------------------

In this mode, we expect to run a bunch of services to run in the background as daemons.
The container is supposed to start them right-away, and they will continue to run until
the container is stopped.

We can use ``docker start container`` to start an existing container.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker start mycontainer
    mycontainer

This means our container was successfully started. To check if it is running,
we can use ``docker container ls -a``.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker container ls -a
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND       CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES
    306b5af9ab3b   ubuntu:22.04   "/bin/bash"   23 minutes ago   Exited (0) 12 seconds ago             mycontainer

As we can see, it was executed, but started right away because the container image
``entry-point`` is set to the interactive ``bash`` command, which won't receive any commands.

To exemplify how a container image with a background service would behave, we
can use a different container image using a brand new command:
``docker run -d --name container_name container_image:tag`` to fetch the container image,
create a new container and start it detached in the background (``-d``).

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker run -d --name nginx nginx:latest

    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                     PORTS     NAMES

As we can see, the nginx container is up and running right away. And will continue like that until stopped.
To hop into the terminal of the container and interact with the server container, we use
``docker exec -it container command``.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker exec -it nginx bash

    root@d2f93616ff56:/# htop

After installing ``htop`` and running it, we get the list of running processes within the container.

.. image:: img/nginx_container_htop.png
   :width: 100%

After finishing our work, we can exit the container with a simple ``exit`` command.
And then, we can stop our container with ``docker container stop containername``.

.. sourcecode:: console

    root@d2f93616ff56:/# exit
    $ docker container stop nginx
    nginx
    $ docker container ls -a
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES

Running interactively
---------------------

In this mode, we jump straight to the container command line. Super useful for testing,
not so much for deployment. Since it is typical to throw away test containers right away,
it is not really necessary to give them a name.

The command for it is ``docker run -it image_name:tag``

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker run -it ubuntu:23.04
    Unable to find image 'ubuntu:23.04' locally

    d2f93616ff56   nginx:latest   "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"   22 minutes ago   Exited (0) 9 minutes ago             nginx

As we can see above, we now have a new container with a randomly assigned name (``festive_mclean``)
with the ``ubuntu:23.04`` docker image.

Cleaning up containers and images
---------------------------------

All of these containers are stopped, and their images won't be removed from your system until
containers using them are removed. To remove all stopped containers, use ``docker container prune``.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker container prune
    WARNING! This will remove all stopped containers.
    Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
    Deleted Containers:

    Total reclaimed space: 20.63MB

Then, we can remove the docker container images with ``docker image prune -a``:

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker image prune -a
    WARNING! This will remove all images without at least one container associated to them.
    Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y

    Total reclaimed space: 334.9MB

We can check if all containers and images were correctly removed with
``docker container ls -a`` and ``docker image ls -a``.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker container ls -a
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
    $ docker image ls -a
    REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID   CREATED   SIZE

Next, we check how to expose services hosted inside the container to the external
network from which the host is part of.

Exposing ports to the container
-------------------------------

Since we can containerize a service inside a container, we need to expose its
services via network ports.

This is done by specifying a port mapping with
``docker container create -p external_port:internal_port ...``
or ``docker run -it -p external_port:internal_port ...``.

Let's try with the following Python script running within the container.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker run -it -p 80:1234 ubuntu:22.04
    Unable to find image 'ubuntu:22.04' locally

Let's try a different port number.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker run -it -p 1234:8000 ubuntu:22.04

With our server running inside the container, we can then try to access it from our
host machine from a different terminal.

.. sourcecode:: console

    <li><a href="etc/">etc/</a></li>
    ...

As shown above, we connected to the server inside the container and fetched the list
of files in the current directory of the server (which is the root directory of the container).

On the server side, we get the following updates:

.. sourcecode:: console

    root@c37de818fc9d:/# python3 -m http.server
    Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
    172.17.0.1 - - [28/Nov/2023 14:48:46] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -

This is very useful, but still limited since files inside the container are stored
in a docker volume. We see how to expose the file system next.

Mounting external drives into the container
-------------------------------------------

Super useful. Configuration files and data should always be stored outside of the
container, allowing for proper backup and recovery in case the container and its
volumes get deleted.

The mapping is done similarly to the ports seen above.
``docker container create -v external_path:internal_path ...``
or ``docker run -it -v external_path:internal_path ...``.

Let's see an example.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ mkdir test
    $ mkdir test/banana
    $ docker run -it -v ./test:/internal/mapping/of/test ubuntu:22.04
    root@217bab8dd20e:/# cd /internal/mapping/of/test/
    root@217bab8dd20e:/internal/mapping/of/test# ls
    banana
    root@217bab8dd20e:/internal/mapping/of/test# rm -R banana
    root@217bab8dd20e:/internal/mapping/of/test# exit
    exit
    $ ls ./test

As we can see, the directory ``banana`` was created inside the ``test`` directory.
We then mounted ``test`` as ``/internal/mapping/of/test`` inside of the container.

The container then walked to that directory, listed the ``banana`` directory and
finally deleted it.

After exiting the container, we can see the removal of the ``banana`` directory was
propagated to the external directory as expected.

At this point, you have enough knowledge to use Docker for general purpose testing,
but not for containerizing your own service for redistribution. We learn this next.

Building your own container
---------------------------

Building your container is just as easy as 1-2-3.

1. Write your setup within Dockerfile
2. Build your Docker container image
3. Testing your container

Here we enter in details on how to perform each step.

1 Write your setup within Dockerfile
************************************

The ``Dockerfile`` file contains the recipe of your container.

Let's build a container with the python webserver from before, but now properly setup.

.. sourcecode:: text

    # Our base image
    FROM ubuntu:23.04
    # Install the required packages
    RUN apt update && apt install -y python3
    # Expose service port externally, mapping to the host port
    EXPOSE 8000
    # Copy www directory from the current host build directory to the container
    COPY "www" "/www"
    # Start the service
    CMD ["python3", "-m", "http.server", "--directory", "/www"]

Now we need a ``www`` directory.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ mkdir www

After adding our files to host to the www directory, we can proceed to build the container image.

2 Build your Docker container image
***********************************

The ``docker build`` command accepts a tag (``-t``) that will be used to identify the container
image later (e.g. ``ubuntu:20.04``), and a Dockerfile (``-f``) as parameters. The last argument
is always a path to a directory (``.``) that will be copied to within the container build procedure, and
will be discarded later, unless explicitly copied to the container.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker build -t myimage:latest -f Dockerfile .
    DEPRECATED: The legacy builder is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
                Install the buildx component to build images with BuildKit:

And voilÃ , our container image is ready.
Of course, we need to check it before deploying it in production.

3. Testing your container
*************************

Let's first start it in non-interactive mode to see if the webserver is running.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker container create --name mycontainer myimage:latest
    069b16633dcf913bf2f68b95e523fad00373314b10c8080e7e485418fe5c5ade
    $ docker start mycontainer
    mycontainer
    $ gabriel@Ryzen:/mnt/dev/tools/source/ORAN_testbed_docs$ docker container ls
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE            COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS         PORTS      NAMES
    069b16633dcf   myimage:latest   "python3 -m http.serâ€¦"   13 seconds ago   Up 3 seconds   8000/tcp   mycontainer

Awesome. Now we can check if the ``www`` directory was properly copied to the
root of the container.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker exec mycontainer ls | grep www
    www
    $ docker exec -it mycontainer bash
    root@069b16633dcf:/# cd www
    root@069b16633dcf:/www#

As we can see, yes, it was copied correctly.

Now we can stop and tear down the test container.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker container stop mycontainer
    mycontainer
    $ docker container prune
    WARNING! This will remove all stopped containers.

.. _Gitlab Container Registry: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/
.. _Docker Registry: https://hub.docker.com/_/registry

The last missing piece is publishing our container. Either publicly via
`Docker Hub`_, as a `Gitlab Container Registry`_, or privately to a `Docker Registry`_.

Publishing your own container
-----------------------------

Let's publish our container to our own private registry, typically done in organizations.

To start the registry using newly acquired Docker knowledge, run:

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart always --name registry registry:2
    Unable to find image 'registry:2' locally

    $ docker container ls
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE        COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                       NAMES

Now that we have the registry running, we can push our image ``myimage:latest`` to the registry.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker tag myimage:latest localhost:5000/myimage:latest
    $ docker push localhost:5000/myimage:latest
    The push refers to repository [localhost:5000/myimage]
    2125872a3000: Pushed
    41447c8a4634: Pushed

To check that this is not a fluke, let's first remove the local container image.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker image prune -a
    WARNING! This will remove all images without at least one container associated to them.

    Total reclaimed space: 235.4MB

Now let's download it from the registry:

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker image pull localhost:5000/myimage:latest
    latest: Pulling from myimage
    850c66215014: Pull complete

    Status: Downloaded newer image for localhost:5000/myimage:latest
    localhost:5000/myimage:latest

And we can test it again:

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ docker run -it localhost:5000/myimage:latest
